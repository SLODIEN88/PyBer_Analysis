# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type. This was done by calculating the total rides, number of drivers and the sum of all the fares. With the information got, I was supposed to create a five thirty eight graph to illustate the results as shown down below. The data differs slightly from city to city as show below. With the information, I got, I was able to provide recommendations to the Pyber CEO

# Results
As you can tell from the images below, the urban cities have most amount of rides, hence the highest total fares. Suburban cities came in close second. And the rural cities came in last because not so many people took the rides, hence the low fares

A multiple line chart called the five thirty eight graph as seen below was ran to help me visualize the data with the specific dates given of January 1st, 2019 to April 29th, 2019 for each city type

# Summary
The rural areas had fewer rides hence the low fares. This could be due to alot of reasons, but I think mostly there are not enough cars there.  The Urban had the most rides, hence the higher fares. And Suburban came in close second. With this information, the CEO can make an educated guess on where to pour more resources if he wants to increase revenue.
